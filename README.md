# Zoned 2-of-3 Multisig Custody Plan

## 1. Purpose and Threat Model

This document is a practical guideline for a single user who wants to use a 2-of-3 multisig Bitcoin wallet to defend against three common real-world risks:

-1. Coercion – being forced to sign a transaction.

-2. Confiscation by authority – loss of devices or keys within a jurisdiction or failure domain.

-3. Key loss – device failure, misplacement, or destruction of backups.

It is useful to think of Bitcoin custody as serving two related but distinct functions:

- Signing — authorizing a spend.
- Recovery — restoring the ability to sign after loss.
In a standard 2-of-3 multisig setup, these two functions share the same underlying policy:

- Signing policy: 2-of-3 signers are required to spend.
- Recovery policy: 2-of-3 seed phrases are sufficient to recover access.
This differs from designs such as SLIP-39 (Shamir) backups, where a wallet may use a single signer for spending but a threshold scheme (e.g., 2-of-3) for recovery of a master seed. In a multisig wallet built on standard BIP39 seed phrase backups, the signer seeds themselves are the recovery material, so signing and recovery necessarily overlap.

This overlap is practical and acceptable. A 2-of-3 recovery policy provides a strong balance between redundancy and simplicity, while requiring two independent signers to spend offers meaningful protection against loss of funds due to coercion.

## 2. Zoning Concept

The core abstraction of this design is zoning.

A zone is defined as a failure domain, not a specific geography. It represents a cluster of at least two independent locations that are expected to fail together under a single adverse event (e.g., coercion, confiscation, disaster, or access denial).

Zones are intentionally designed around risk correlation, not convenience or distance.

Different zones can lean toward different functions:

- Signing-oriented zones prioritize availability and routine access.
- Recovery-oriented zones prioritize survivability and long-term continuity.
For example:

- One zone may consist of two or more locations used primarily for transaction signing.
- Another zone may consist of two or more locations that collectively hold credentials, documentation, and recovery knowledge.
The key idea is separation by function and failure mode.

A single zone failure must not eliminate both the ability to sign and the ability to recover.

This document focuses on zoning as a conceptual tool. Specific physical layouts, storage methods, and implementation details are intentionally left flexible and user-defined.

## 3. Security and Design Principles

These principles guide implementation choices. They are defaults, not hard requirements.

### Simplicity and Uniformity

- Signers are implemented using single-vendor hardware devices
- Credentials (passphrases and encryption passwords) are standardized
- The objective is to reduce user error and long-term lockout risk

### User-Introduced Entropy

User-introduced entropy matters primarily when the user does not have complete confidence in device-generated seed phrases.

- If a private key is assumed to be 100% securely generated by trusted hardware, a passphrase is not strictly required.
- If that assumption is weakened, user-introduced entropy becomes a core security property, not an optional feature.
Accordingly:

- Critical passphrases and encryption passwords are user-generated, not device-generated.
- Passphrases are generated using physical randomness (e.g., dice rolls) mapped to a Diceware word list.
This ensures secrets are:

- Independent of hardware vendors and wallet standards
- Resistant to compromised RNGs or biased entropy sources
The design treats user-introduced entropy as mandatory under uncertainty, and optional only under strong trust assumptions.

### Cryptography over Obscurity

- All sensitive information is encrypted
- No reliance on hiding, mislabeling, or secrecy of storage media
- Clear labeling is acceptable because security derives from encryption and separation

### Memory Usage Rules

- Seeds are never memorized
- Memory is used only for redundancy (e.g., encryption passwords)
- No signing capability depends solely on human memory

### Privacy as a Security Property

Privacy is considered to be almost as important as fund security.

- Wallet descriptors and metadata are treated as sensitive
- No plaintext descriptors, XPUBs, or configuration QR codes are stored

## 4. Wallet Components

### 4.1 Wallet Components

The wallet setup consists of the following components:

- Three signing devices, each holding one signing key
- Three seed phrase backups, one for each signing key
- One wallet descriptor defining the 2-of-3 multisig policy
- One recovery instruction document
- One passphrase backup (if a passphrase is used)
These components are the complete set required for signing and recovery.

### 4.2 Layout Design Constraints

Treat the user’s presence and memory (“the brain”) as a security-relevant component. The layout is designed to satisfy two constraints.

**Constraint A — No single location + user present (local coercion resistance)**

Even if the user is physically present and can recall all required information, it must not be possible to spend from a single location. Spending must require access to two or more distinct locations to assemble the multisig signing threshold.

This targets local coercion, where an adversary can control one location and potentially the user at that location.

**Constraint B — No single zone without the user (jurisdictional confiscation resistance)**

If the user is not present, material contained within Zone A alone or Zone B alone must be insufficient to spend. An adversary must need information from both zones to recover enough capability to spend.

This primarily targets confiscation or seizure risk within the user’s residential jurisdiction.

### 4.3 Limitation: Jurisdiction-Level Coercion

Assume a high-capability adversary can detain the user and access all locations within Zone A. Under this threat, requiring two locations to spend inside the same zone does not help: the adversary can obtain whatever is needed across the zone, including user-held information.

**Constraint A does not address jurisdiction-level coercion. Resisting this class of attack generally requires that spending cannot be completed using only materials located inside the adversary-controlled jurisdiction (i.e., at least one critical element must be outside Zone A).**

### 4.4 Storage Rules for Critical Information

For critical information, use a 3-2-1 guideline, not a hard rule:

- 3 copies total
- stored on 2 different media types
- with 1 copy off-site
This guideline exists to reduce correlated loss, not to enforce rigid placement.

Documents (recovery instructions, descriptor backup, wallet backup metadata):

- Maintain three copies in total
- At least two copies should be physical
- Physical copies should preferably be stored in different locations
- One copy may be encrypted and stored off-site (e.g., cloud storage)
Passphrase (if used):

- Treat the user’s brain as one copy (memorized passphrase)
- Maintain two additional physical copies
- Physical copies should preferably be stored in different locations
- The passphrase must not be stored in digital form, including cloud storage

### 4.5 Example Layout (Constraints A&B)

Goal: Zone A is the primary spending zone; Zone B is the primary storage zone. Spending is only intended to occur in Zone A.

Assumptions: 2-of-3 multisig (Key A/Key B/Key C) with BIP39 seeds (Seed A/Seed B/Seed C). A passphrase is used and must have at least one physical copy. Constraints A and B apply to both zones.

#### Zone A — Primary Spending Zone

Zone A has two distinct locations (A1 and A2).

- A1 stores: Signer device Key A + Seed A backup.
- A2 stores: Signer device Key B + Seed B backup.
Operational rule: Routine spending uses Key A (A1) + Key B (A2).

#### Zone B — Primary Storage Zone

Zone B has two distinct locations (B1 and B2).

- B1 stores: physical passphrase copy (P1) + encrypted docs copy D1 (descriptor + recovery instructions).
- B2 stores: Seed C backup + encrypted docs copy D2.

#### Why this satisfies the constraints

- Constraint A (both zones): No single location contains 2 signing devices or 2 seed backups; a single location cannot produce a spend even with the user present.
- Constraint B (both zones): Zone A without the user lacks the passphrase physical copy; Zone B without the user lacks two seeds (only Seed C) and lacks any two signer devices; neither zone alone is sufficient to spend.
- Constraint C: At least one physical passphrase copy exists (P1 at B1).
- Constraint D: Routine spending is performed only in Zone A (A1 + A2).

## 5. Closing Note

This plan is designed to be durable under real-world failure: a single lost device, a single compromised location, or a single zone outage should not immediately translate into loss of funds. Its main trade-off is operational friction: spending requires deliberate movement across two locations in Zone A, and recovery requires controlled access to Zone B.

Treat this document as a living policy. Revisit it when your living situation, travel patterns, or jurisdictional risk changes. At minimum, perform a periodic dry-run (without broadcasting) to confirm that you can still locate materials, assemble a PSBT workflow, and recover wallet state from the descriptor and backups.
